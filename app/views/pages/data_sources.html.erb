    To provide you with the best possible user experience, we use miscellanous data sources to deliver the best search results.
    Apart from our own, we may partially deliver data from different sources, such as <%= link_to 'Foursquare', 'https://foursquare.com' %>, <%= link_to 'Google Places', 'http://places.google.com' %>, <%= link_to 'HERE', 'http://places.here.com' %> or <%= link_to 'Yelp', 'http://www.yelp.com' %>.
    In such case, the search result and the corresponding result detail page are marked with one of the following logotypes or icons:

    Logotypes<br /><br />
    <%= image_tag 'powered-by/foursquare@2x.png', class: "", title: "Foursquare API logotype", onload: "this.width/=2;this.onload=null;" %><br /><br />
    <%= image_tag 'powered-by/google@2x.png', class: "", title: "Google Places API logotype", onload: "this.width/=2;this.onload=null;" %><br /><br />
    <%= image_tag 'powered-by/nokia@2x.png', class: "", title: "HERE API logotype", onload: "this.width/=2;this.onload=null;" %><br /><br />
    <%= image_tag 'powered-by/yelp@2x.png', class: "", title: "Yelp API logotype", onload: "this.width/=2;this.onload=null;" %><br /><br />
    Icons<br /><br />
    <%= image_tag 'powered-by/icon/foursquare@2x.png', title: 'Foursquare API icon', class: "", title: "Foursquare API icon", onload: "this.width/=2;this.onload=null;" %>
    <%= image_tag 'powered-by/icon/google@2x.png', title: 'Google Places API icon', class: "", title: "Google Places API icon", onload: "this.width/=2;this.onload=null;" %>
